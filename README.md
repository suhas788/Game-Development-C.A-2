# Game-Development-C.A-2

We all have played maze game in some activity books but this time its time to play on the screen . This game is built by using HTML , CSS and Javascript . By using arrow keys we can move the the emoji incon towards the house icon and can help the emoji reach the exit point . The game has some time constrain and user/player has to finish the game with the time constrain ; otherwise the game ends by signalling time up . You can go on playing as many levels as possible and time constrain must be kept in mind .
